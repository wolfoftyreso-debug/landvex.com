      <DocHeading>What we collect and why</DocHeading>
      <DocText>
        The form collects name, organisation, work email and a description of what
        you need. We use that to reply and, if it goes further, to scope the work.
        The form is optional; without those details we cannot reply. The legal
        basis is legitimate interests in answering a business
        enquiry (GDPR art. 6(1)(f)), and taking steps prior to a contract if the
        conversation becomes an engagement (art. 6(1)(b)).

        items={[
          "We do not use the form for marketing lists or newsletters.",
          "This website does not set analytics, advertising or other non-essential cookies.",
          "A hidden field is used to ignore obvious bot submissions. Those submissions are discarded and not emailed.",
        ]}
      />

      <DocHeading>Who receives the data</DocHeading>
      <DocText>
        The message is emailed to {site.email} through Resend, which we use as a
        processor for delivery. The site is hosted on AWS. Resend may process data
        in the United States. Where GDPR applies, that is an international transfer;
        we rely on the provider’s Standard Contractual Clauses and their published
        data-processing terms. We do not sell personal data.
      </DocText>
      <DocText>
        Hosting and abuse controls may process IP address and user agent as part of
        the request. We do not operate a separate database of form submissions on
        this website; the record is the email.
      </DocText>

      <DocHeading>Retention</DocHeading>
      <DocText>
        Mail is kept as long as needed to answer you. If we do not take on the work,
        we delete or archive the thread within 24 months, unless a longer legal duty
        applies.
