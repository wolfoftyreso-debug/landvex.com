        Multi-account setups, IAM, networking and infrastructure as code, built in
        your cloud account rather than ours. Data residency is set at the account
        boundary, not by a policy that asks people to remember where a file lives.

      <DocHeading>What you own</DocHeading>
      <DocText>
        The code is in your accounts, the infrastructure is code, and there is no
        proprietary lock-in on what we build for you. Handover is the end of every
        engagement, not an upsell: you get working systems and the code that built
        them — not a black box you cannot open.
      </DocText>

      <DocHeading>What ships with the system</DocHeading>
      <DocText>
        Observability, retries and an audit trail are part of the build, not a
        managed service we sell afterwards. Where a system processes documents,
        media or decisions, the trail records what ran, on which input, with which
        result. Running it day to day stays with you; we are a development company
        and do not take on operations.
